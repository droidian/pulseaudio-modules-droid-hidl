PulseAudio Droid HIDL module
============================

About the name
--------------

Even though the name has "hidl" in it, this module actually nowadays
doesn't directly have anything to do with HIDL or Binder for that
matter. All the Binder related implementation is in
audiosystem-passthrough. This module merely provides access
to HAL `set_parameters()` and `get_parameters()` calls from
outside PulseAudio.

module-droid-hidl
-----------------

The purpose of this module is to forward calls made to HIDL API or
AudioFlinger service to active hw module. This means that the module
cannot be loaded independently, it needs to have module-droid-card
or module-droid-{sink,source} or whatever module loaded beforehand
that parses droid configuration and loads the hw module to
PulseAudio global object.

Helper binary is separated to its own package, audiosystem-passthrough.
When using the helper from PulseAudio if the defaults are not suitable
add configuration to PulseAudio sysconfig file. Available options are

    AUDIOSYSTEM_PASSTHROUGH_TYPE={qti,af}
    AUDIOSYSTEM_PASSTHROUGH_IDX={17,18} # only applicable to af type

Normally just compiling the package against your adaptation should
provide working module, but for testing one can also run the helper
binary by hand.

In pa configuration disable helper binary for the module,

    load-module module-droid-hidl helper=false

Run the helper in standalone mode (type can be either qti or af),

    /usr/libexec/audiosystem-passthrough/audiosystem-passthrough -v -a unix:path=.../pulse/dbus-socket -t <type>
